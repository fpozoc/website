I am a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics at [Spanish National Cancer Research Center - CNIO](https://www.cnio.es/en/) [Bioinformatics Unit](https://bioinformatics.cnio.es/). My current research interests include the application of statistical and computing techniques to solve bioinformatics and data driven problems.

Before having the opportunity to be included in this fantastic group, I was improving my scientific and analytics training with some internships within different environments, including pharmaceutical industry or biotechnology research. 

In my previous years as a student, I joined the study of a [BSc. in Health Biology](https://www.uah.es/en/estudios/estudios-oficiales/Degree-in-Health-Biology/) at [University of Alcal√°](https://www.uah.es/en/) with a posterior [MSc. of Bioinformatics for Health Sciences](https://www.upf.edu/web/bioinformatics) at [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/en/) and several technical specializations in statistics, programming and mathematics. This background has given me the opportunity to join the [PhD in Bioinformatics](http://ciencias.biomol.uam.es/info_PHD) at [Autonomous University of Madrid](https://www.uam.es/UAM/01-Autonomous-University-of-Madrid/1242688768755.htm?pid=1242688610441&title=Autonomous%20University%20of%20Madrid,%20Spain%20(Lead)).

My main current research is focused on the study of the functional impact of alternative splicing at protein level. I am also currently involved as one of the members of the [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) project.
