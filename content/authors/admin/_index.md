I am a last year PhD candidate in Bioinformatics at [Spanish National Cancer Research Center - CNIO](https://www.cnio.es/en/) [Bioinformatics Unit](https://bioinformatics.cnio.es/). My current research interests include applying statistical and computing techniques to solve bioinformatics and data-driven problems. Now I am focusing my current primary research on studying the functional impact of alternative splicing at the protein level. I am also currently involved as one of the members of the [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) project.

From 2019, I am participating as a lecturer at the [Advanced Bioinformatics subject (year 4) - B.Sc. in Biotechnology - University Francisco de Vitoria](http://www.ufvinternational.com/en/students-studying-at-ufv/international-student-handbook/biotechnology/). Moreover, from 2021, I lead the [Machine Learning in Healthcare subject](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?&est=350&plan=392&asig=16803&idioma=2) at the [B.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering - UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/data-science) as Visiting Professor.

In my previous years as a student, I joined the study of a [BSc. in Health Biology](https://www.uah.es/en/estudios/estudios-oficiales/Degree-in-Health-Biology/) at [University of Alcal√°](https://www.uah.es/en/) with a posterior [MSc. of Bioinformatics for Health Sciences](https://www.upf.edu/web/bioinformatics) at [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/en/) and several technical specializations in statistics, programming and mathematics. I was also improving my scientific and analytics training with some internships within different environments, including the pharmaceutical industry or biotechnology research. This background has allowed me to join the [PhD in Bioinformatics](http://ciencias.biomol.uam.es/info_PHD) at [Autonomous University of Madrid](https://www.uam.es/UAM/01-Autonomous-University-of-Madrid/1242688768755.htm?pid=1242688610441&title=Autonomous%20University%20of%20Madrid,%20Spain%20(Lead)).
