I am a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics at [CNIO](https://www.cnio.es/en/) [Bioinformatics Unit](https://bioinformatics.cnio.es/) (Madrid, Spain). My current research interests include the application of statistical and computing techniques to solve bioinformatics and data driven problems.

Before having the opportunity to be included in this fantastic group, I was improving my scientific and analytics training with some internships within different environments, including pharmaceutical industry or biotechnology research. 

In my previous years as a student, I joined the study of a [BSc. in Health Biology](https://www.uah.es/en/estudios/estudios-oficiales/Degree-in-Health-Biology/) (University of Alcal√°) with a posterior [MSc. of Bioinformatics for Health Sciences](https://www.upf.edu/web/bioinformatics) (Pompeu Fabra University) and several technical specializations in statistics, programming and mathematics. This background has given me the opportunity to join the [PhD in Molecular Biosciences](http://ciencias.biomol.uam.es/info_PHD) (Autonomous University of Madrid)

My main current research is focused on the study of the functional impact of alternative splicing at protein level. I am also currently involved as one of the members of the [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) project.
