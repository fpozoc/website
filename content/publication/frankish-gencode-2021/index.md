abstract: 'The GENCODE project annotates human and mouse genes and transcripts supported
  by experimental data with high accuracy, providing a foundational resource that
  supports genome biology and clinical genomics. GENCODE annotation processes make
  use of primary data and bioinformatic tools and analysis generated both within the
  consortium and externally to support the creation of transcript structures and the
  determination of their function. Here, we present improvements to our annotation
  infrastructure, bioinformatics tools, and analysis, and the advances they support
  in the annotation of the human and mouse genomes including: the completion of first
  pass manual annotation for the mouse reference genome; targeted improvements to
  the annotation of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; collaborative projects
  to achieve convergence across reference annotation databases for the annotation
  of human and mouse protein-coding genes; and the first GENCODE manually supervised
  automated annotation of lncRNAs. Our annotation is accessible via Ensembl, the UCSC
  Genome Browser and https://www.gencodegenes.org.'
