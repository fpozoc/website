abstract: 'In lung cancer immunotherapy, biomarkers to guide clinical decisions are
  limited. We now explore whether the detailed immunophenotyping of circulating peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can predict the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
  in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We determined 107
  PBMCs subpopulations in a prospective cohort of NSCLC patients before starting single-agent
  anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (study group), analyzed by flow cytometry. As a control
  group, we studied patients with advanced malignancies before initiating non-immunotherapy
  treatment. The frequency of PBMCs was correlated with treatment outcome. Patients
  were categorized as having either high or low expression for each biomarker, defined
  as those above the 55th or below the 45th percentile of the overall marker expression
  within the cohort. In the study group, three subpopulations were associated with
  significant differences in outcome: high pretreatment levels of circulating CD4+CCR9+,
  CD4+CCR10+, or CD8+CXCR4+ T cells correlated with poorer overall survival (15.7
  vs. 35.9 months, HR 0.16, p = 0.003; 22.0 vs. NR months, HR 0.10, p = 0.003, and
  22.0 vs. NR months, HR 0.29, p = 0.02). These differences were specific to immunotherapy-treated
  patients. High baseline levels of circulating T cell subpopulations related to tissue
  lymphocyte recruitment are associated with poorer outcomes of immunotherapy-treated
  advanced NSCLC patients.'
