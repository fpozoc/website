abstract: APPRIS (https://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es) is a well-established database housing
  annotations for protein isoforms for a range of species. APPRIS selects principal
  isoforms based on protein structure and function features and on cross-species conservation.
  Most coding genes produce a single main protein isoform and the principal isoforms
  chosen by the APPRIS database best represent this main cellular isoform. Human genetic
  data, experimental protein evidence and the distribution of clinical variants all
  support the relevance of APPRIS principal isoforms. APPRIS annotations and principal
  isoforms have now been expanded to 10 model organisms. In this paper we highlight
  the most recent updates to the database. APPRIS annotations have been generated
  for two new species, cow and chicken, the protein structural information has been
  augmented with reliable models from the EMBL-EBI AlphaFold database, and we have
  substantially expanded the confirmatory proteomics evidence available for the human
  genome. The most significant change in APPRIS has been the implementation of TRIFID
  functional isoform scores. TRIFID functional scores are assigned to all splice isoforms,
  and APPRIS uses the TRIFID functional scores and proteomics evidence to determine
  principal isoforms when core methods cannot.
